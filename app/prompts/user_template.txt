User inputs:
{{inputs_json}}

Candidate shoes (from rules filter):
{{candidate_table}}

Task:
For each candidate, write 2â€“3 sentences:
- Why it fits the user's intended runs/races,
- Any tradeoffs (weight, plate type, feel),
- Budget awareness (mark "above budget" if price > max).

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, one per candidate, in the exact format:
["explanation for shoe 1", "explanation for shoe 2", "explanation for shoe 3"]

Do not include any other text, code fences, or formatting. Just the JSON array.
