User inputs:
{{inputs_json}}

Candidate shoes (from rules filter):
{{candidate_table}}

Task:
For each candidate, write 2â€“3 sentences that:
- Tie the shoe to the user's intended runs/races (e.g., daily, tempo, race distances if provided),
- Reference at least two concrete specs (e.g., plate type, drop, weight, cushioning level, support/stability, heel/forefoot stack),
- Include budget awareness (mark "above budget" if price > max and give a one-phrase justification).

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, one per candidate, in the exact format:
["explanation for shoe 1", "explanation for shoe 2", "explanation for shoe 3"]

Do not include any other text, code fences, or formatting. Just the JSON array.
